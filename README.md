# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview
A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. They have requested a report that includes 

* what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market; and 
* how they could be grouped to create a classification system.

Since there is no known output, we have decided to use ```unsupervised learning``` to group the cryptocurrencies by clustering algorithms. We also use data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

### Technologies/libraries used

* Pandas, a Python library used for data munging 
* Scikit-learn, an ML algorithm library that integrates with NumPy and SciPy
* Plotly, a graphing library that makes interactive, publication-quality charts
* Hvplot, a high-level plotting library that uses HolovViews and Bokeh

### Resources used
* Data Source: crypto_data.csv
    * Here is an example of the dataset:
